# Life Compass API

**Life Compass** is a **FastAPI-based backend service** that generates a structured personal development profile using precise astronomical calculations of lunar nodes.

The project is designed as a **production-style REST API** and demonstrates skills required for the US market:

* backend service design
* FastAPI & Pydantic
* object-oriented business logic
* logging and error handling
* clean Python project structure

---

## Project Purpose

The service accepts a date, time, and place of birth and calculates:

* ☋ **South Lunar Node** — habitual patterns and comfort zone
* ☊ **North Lunar Node** — growth direction and development vector
* sign axis and house axis of the lunar nodes
* a structured, explainable transition profile

All calculations are **deterministic**, transparent, and based on astronomical data — no randomness or simplified lookup tables.

---

## API Capabilities

* REST API built with FastAPI
* Automatic Swagger documentation (`/docs`)
* Input validation using Pydantic models
* Business logic encapsulated in a dedicated service class (OOP)
* Request, error, and process logging
* Integration with external data sources (coordinates, time zones)

> The project structure is functionally equivalent to the reference structure from the technical assignment
> (`app.py`, `core.py`, `schemas.py`, `logger.py`, `config.py`, `utilities.py`),
> organized as a Python package for better scalability.

##  Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

3. Activate the environment:

**Windows**

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

##  Running the Server

```bash
python run.py
```

After startup, open:

* Swagger UI: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

---

## 🔌 API Endpoints

* **GET /** — service status
* **GET /health** — health check
* **POST /profile** — generate Life Compass profile
* **GET /profile/place?q=...** — resolve place (coordinates and timezone)

---

## Request Examples

### POST /profile

```json
{
  "birth_date": "1995-11-18",
  "birth_time": "14:30",
  "birth_place": "Minsk"
}
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "title": "Sagittarius South Node → Gemini North Node",
  "bridge": "From absolute truth → to dialogue",
  "sections": [...],
  "recommendations": [...],
  "motto": "Truth is born in dialogue"
}
```

---

### GET /profile/place

```
/profile/place?q=Minsk
```

Response:

```json
{
  "query": "Minsk",
  "lat": 53.9,
  "lon": 27.56,
  "timezone": "Europe/Minsk"
}
```

---

## Logging

The service uses structured logging:

* console output
* file logging to `logs/service.log`
* log levels: `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`

The following events are logged:

* service startup
* incoming HTTP requests
* key calculation steps
* errors and exceptions

---

## Health & Verification

* The server starts using `python run.py`
* All endpoints are available via Swagger
* Logs are written to both console and `logs/service.log`
